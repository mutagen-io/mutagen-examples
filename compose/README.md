# Project examples

This directory contains examples that use
[Mutagen's Docker Compose integration](https://mutagen.io/documentation/orchestration/compose)
to automate the creation of Mutagen synchronization and forwarding sessions with
Compose-based projects. The examples in this directory can be run using Docker
Desktop or using a cloud-based Docker host. In both cases, you'll be able to
edit code and access applications locally.
