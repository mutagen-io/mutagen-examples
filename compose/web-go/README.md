# Go-based web application

This directory contains an example [Go](https://golang.org/)-based web
application designed to be developed and run on a cloud-based container host
(though it can also be run locally, e.g. via
[Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop)). It uses
[Mutagen's support for Docker Compose](https://mutagen.io/documentation/orchestration/compose)
to synchronize code from the local filesystem to a shared container volume and
to forward network traffic to the various containerized services, allowing you
to edit code and access the application locally, regardless of where the project
is running.


## Usage

This example behaves like any other Composed-based projectâ€”you'll just need to
replace any `docker-compose` command with `mutagen compose`. Once the project is
running, you can access the application at
[http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080). Note that it may take a few
seconds for the frontend components of the application to build when starting
for the first time. Once the project is running, try editing the source code for
the frontend components and refreshing your browser. For more information, check
out the [documentation](https://mutagen.io/documentation/orchestration/compose).
