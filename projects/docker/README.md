# Docker project examples

This directory contains example development environments that use Mutagen's
[Docker container transport](https://mutagen.io/documentation/transports/docker)
for code synchronization and network forwarding. If you're using a Compose-based
project, then you'll likely be more interested in
[Mutagen's Docker Compose integration](https://mutagen.io/documentation/orchestration/compose)
than using Mutagen projects and the Docker transport directly.
