# Mutagen Examples

This repository contains example projects that use Mutagen's
[orchestration features](https://mutagen.io/documentation/orchestration). There
are two types of examples: those that use
[Mutagen Compose](https://mutagen.io/documentation/orchestration/compose) and
those that use Mutagen's older
[projects feature](https://mutagen.io/documentation/orchestration/projects).
